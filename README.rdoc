= Pinch

Retrieve a file from inside a zip file, over the network!

Pinch makes it possible to download a specific file from within a ZIP file
over HTTP/1.1 using nothing but the Ruby Standard Library (net/http and zlib)

Pinch is the Ruby implementation of an idea that my colleague Edward Patel
had a while back.

The first version was written in Objective-C and we thought it would be cool
if we could bring that functionality to Ruby :)

That version is available on https://github.com/epatel/pinch-objc/

Iâ€™ve tested Pinch on 1.9.3, 1.9.2, 1.8.7, MacRuby 0.10, JRuby 1.6.4 and rbx-head, YMMV.

The specs currently blows up on MagLev.

== Installation

    gem install pinch

== Usage example

    require 'pinch'

    data = Pinch.get 'http://peterhellberg.github.com/pinch/test.zip', 'data.json'

    puts data

== Patch to use Pinch against Amazon S3 storage with pre-signed urls
AWS S3 storage verifies url signature against HTTP verb, therefore requiring different pre-signed urls for HEAD and GET requests. Patch extends Pinch gem to accept hash or 2 urls, allowing to fetch items stored in zip archives on S3.

require 'pinch'

require 'right_aws'

s3 = RightAws::S3Generator.new('...','...')

bucket = s3.bucket('my-bucket')

head_ticket = bucket.key('test.zip').head

get_ticket = bucket.key('test.zip').get

data=Pinch.get({:head => head_url, :get => get_url},'data.json')
