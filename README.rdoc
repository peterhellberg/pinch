= Pinch

Retrieve a file from inside a zip file, over the network!

Pinch makes it possible to download a specific file from within a ZIP file
over HTTP/1.1 using nothing but the Ruby Standard Library (net/http and zlib)

Pinch is the Ruby implementation of an idea that my colleague Edward Patel
had a while back.

The first version was written in Objetive-C and we thought it would be cool 
if we could bring that functionality to Ruby :)

Iâ€™ve tested Pinch on 1.9.2. YMMV.

== Installation

    gem install pinch

== Usage example

    require 'pinch'

    data = Pinch.get 'URL_TO_ZIP_FILE', 'path/file.ext'

    puts data
